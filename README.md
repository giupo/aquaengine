##Branches

The engine source code is published in 2 branches:

* [master](https://github.com/tiagovcosta/aquaengine/tree/master) - Includes the latest improvements. As soon as new features are usable they're merged into this branch. This branch might have small bugs but will always compile.
* [release](https://github.com/tiagovcosta/aquaengine/tree/release) - Fully tested, production ready releases.

Private branches are used to track live changes and start development of new features. Code in those branches, may be buggy and not compile. If you want more info or access to them [contact me](mailto:tiago.costav@gmail.com).
